# Musical Instruments

> Live music, played by the players of TF-Minecraft.

Musical Instruments turns held items into instruments for performances, tavern gatherings, and spontaneous music. An instrument in the off-hand makes the hotbar a set of playable notes, with sneaking providing an alternate note or chord layout.

Sounds play at the performer's location for nearby listeners, while floating note particles give each performance a visual presence.

## Features

- **Multitrack recording** — record successive takes while hearing the other tracks, preview the mix, and keep or discard each take.
- **Player-made records** — publish immutable song editions onto physical discs, copy them, and play them from ordinary jukeboxes.
- **Visual recording studio** — staff can use `/music studio` anywhere for track rows, volume and mute controls, take review, and publishing onto a disc held on the cursor. Player station integration is pending.
- **Song projects** — open your project library, create up to 36 songs, and keep each project's tracks and pending take independently. Right-click a song to delete it after confirmation.
- **Project settings**: rename your song, adjust tempo and toggle the recording metronome from a dedicated inventory page.
- **Live hotbar performance** — changing hotbar slots triggers the instrument's notes immediately.
- **Alternate notes and chords** — sneaking opens a second set of sounds for the same instrument.
- **Repeatable notes** — the selected slot resets after a note so players can play it again.
- **Distinct instrument voices** — each instrument has its own sound mappings, pitch, and volume.
- **Custom instrument items** — supports vanilla items and instrument items from MMOItems, ItemsAdder, and Nexo.
- **In-game note reference** — players can view the keybind layout for the instrument they are holding.

## Documentation

[Project documentation](https://github.com/TF-Minecraft/Docs/blob/main/projects/MusicalInstruments/README.md)

Staff can use `/music studio` anywhere with `instruments.studio` (default: op).
Player access through a dedicated station is pending; jukebox sneak-right-click
remains available to MMOItems and ordinary right-click plays/ejects discs.
Choose a song or **Create a new song**, enter its title, and hold an instrument
in your off-hand. The library fills all 36 middle slots in order. When full,
right-click an old song and confirm its deletion before creating another one.
Each horizontal row controls one track: record, volume, mute, listen, keep and
discard. The bottom bar controls the full mix and stops recording or preview.
**Project settings** opens separate title, tempo and metronome controls. The
metronome is heard only by the performer and is never recorded; count-in clicks
always play. Pick up exactly one music disc and place it on **Publish full song**.
The encoded disc returns to the cursor with the same material; no blank-disc
preparation is needed. A previously recorded disc needs a second click within
10 seconds to confirm overwriting. Other copies keep their earlier edition.
The recording guide is centered; projects with more than four tracks use pages.

Commands are also available: start with `/music new <title>` and use
`/music record 1`. After `/music stop`, listen with `/music preview take` and
accept with `/music keep`. Repeat for the other tracks. Convert an ordinary
music disc with `/music blank`, then hold it in your main hand and use
`/music publish`. `/music help` lists the recording commands.
